## Introduction

Foundation models exhibit strong capabilities for downstream tasks by learning generalized representations through self-supervised pre-training on large datasets. While several foundation models have been developed for single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) data, there is still a lack of models specifically tailored for single-cell ATAC-seq (scATAC-seq), which measures epigenetic information in individual cells. The principal challenge in developing such a model lies in the vast number of scATAC peaks and the significant sparsity of the data, which complicates the formulation of peak-to-peak correlations. To address this challenge, we introduce **EpiFoundation**, a foundation model for learning cell representations from the high-dimensional and sparse space of peaks. EpiFoundation relies on an innovative cross-modality pre-training procedure with two key technical innovations. First, EpiFoundation exclusively processes the non-zero peak set, thereby enhancing the density of cell-specific information within the input data. Second, EpiFoundation utilizes dense gene expression information to supervise the pre-training process, aligning peak-to-gene correlations. EpiFoundation can handle various types of downstream tasks, including cell-type annotation, batch correction, and gene expression prediction. To train and validate EpiFoundation, we curated **MiniAtlas**, a dataset of 100,000+ single cells with paired scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq data, along with diverse test sets spanning various tissues and cell types for robust evaluation. EpiFoundation demonstrates **state-of-the-art performance across multiple tissues and diverse downstream tasks**.

## Data and model Access

- Our paired scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq data for pre-training and fine-tuning can be found at [MiniAtlas](https://huggingface.co/datasets/UCSC-VLAA/MiniAtlas).
- The pre-trained model weights can be found at [EpiFoundation](https://huggingface.co/UCSC-VLAA/EpiFoundation).

## Quick Start

0. prepare conda env from `env.yml`

1. Preprocess your data using `prepare_data.py`

   - call `preprocess()` to process scRNA-seq data, divide the data into train, valid and test set, and perform binning.
   - call `get_pair_data()` to get the paired scATAC-seq data
   - generation of vocabularies
   - Optional: call reduce_data() to transform data into sparse format and reduce the data size.


2. Prepare batch data:

   get the cell and gene vocab:

   ```python
   vocab = GeneVocab.from_file(vocab_config['path'])
   cell_vocab = GeneVocab.from_file(vocab_config['cell_type_path'])
   ```

   Init the paired dataset:

   ```python
   train_set = PairedSCDataset(
        rna_file = data_config['train']['rna_path'],
        atac_file= data_config['train']['atac_path'],
        rna_key = data_config['train']['rna_key'],
        atac_key = data_config['train']['atac_key'],
        rna_vocab = rna_vocab,
        atac_vocab = atac_vocab,
        cell_vocab = cell_vocab,
        batch_vocab= batch_vocab,
        chr_vocab = chr_vocab,
        gene2chr_file= vocab_config['gene2chr_path'],
        rna_max_len = train_config['model']['rna_max_len'],
        atac_max_len = train_config['model']['atac_max_len'],
        pad_token = pad['token'],
        rna_pad_value = pad['value'],
        cls_token = cls['token'],
        # reg_token= reg['token'],
        logger = logger,
    )
   ```

   Get the data loader

   ```python
   train_sampler = DistributedSampler(train_set)
   train_loader = DataLoader(train_set, batch_size=BATCH_SIZE, sampler=train_sampler, num_workers=4)
   ```

   Detailed code can be find in `pretrain_ddp.py`, `pretrain_fsdp.py` and `data/dataloader.py`

3. Construct the model using config from ./configs/test/rna_transformer.yml 

   ```python
   model = EpiFoundation(
        num_class_cell = len(cell_vocab),
        num_rnas = len(rna_vocab),
        num_atacs = len(atac_vocab),
        num_values= data_config['bin_num'],
        num_chrs= len(chr_vocab),
        embed_dim = train_config['model']['embedding_dim'],
        depth = train_config['model']['num_layers'],
        heads = train_config['model']['head_num'],
        head_dim = train_config['model']['head_dim'],
        encoder = model_name,
        dropout = train_config['model']['dropout'],
        pad_token_idx_rna = rna_vocab[pad['token']],
        pad_token_idx_atac = atac_vocab[pad['token']],
        cell_emb_style = train_config['model']['cell_emb_style'],
        mvc_arch_style = train_config['model']['mvc_arch_style'],
        use_batch_labels = train_config['model']['use_batch_labels'],
        batch_label_num= len(batch_vocab),
        use_chr_labels= train_config['model']['use_chr_labels'],
    ).to(device)
   ```
